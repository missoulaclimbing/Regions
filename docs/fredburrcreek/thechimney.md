"The Chimney" IV 5.10+ 8 pitches
FA Steve Porcella, Bruce 1993

"The route, on the north side of the creek, lies on the largest, 
most prominent buttress in the first three miles of the canyon. 
This buttress is quite striking when viewed from the west or east in the 
canyon. The route begins in a large, broken corner that lies 50 feet up 
slope on the southwest corner of the buttress. The climbing is fairly 
easy to begin with, until the corner steepens and the crack pinches down. 
A traverse right leads to a thin crack that gains broken ledges and easier 
rock. The next pitch is the great chimney. Easily visible from the trail, 
this is the most classic pitch (5.9) on the route, and was led by Bruce 
in typically good style. The pitch exits the chimney with easier climbing 
leading right and onto the buttressâ€™s south face. Another five to six 
pitches, varying in length but comprised of short sustained cruxes 
(5.8 to 5.10+), constitute the rest of the climb, as it meanders up the 
south face. No bolts, pitons, or heads were placed. Take a good supply of 
water, as we shared only a quart between us that day, turning our bodies 
into hallucinating raisins."
